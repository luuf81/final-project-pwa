# Final Project - Frontend

Frontend part of the final project (Happy Habits)

## The problem

React, Redux, Node, Mongo, APIs, Sockets, Recharts, Material UI... almost everything from the Technigo Bootcamp plus some more is in there.

## View it live

happyhabits-pwa.netlify.app

This is a progressive web app - meaning that you can install this  on the phone as well as desktop. Especially nice on the phone since it will hide the menu bars and make it feel like a real app (safari on iphone, not tested on android).

If you  encounter any bugs you  might need to clear the cache in the browser and try logging in again (haven't figured out why this is happening...)

Some use cases to try out to see how the app works:

- Log activities
- Create new activities directly from  the exercise picker
- See your activity log below the activity form
- Check your stats under "stats". If you picked an exercise you can also see your recent workout history
- Follow/unfollow other users. This will make their stats appear under the "feed" switch in the activity log, and also show their comparison stats in the radar chart.
- Log in as another user on another device / another browser, log activities and these will not pop up for other users as well (snackbar in the bottom). Of course you will now alo see these users as online in the user list.
